# ESP32 GPS Module Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a GPS module with an ESP32 microcontroller to retrieve and process GPS data. GPS modules provide location, velocity, and time information using NMEA (National Marine Electronics Association) sentences, which can be parsed to extract useful information.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- GPS Module (UART interface)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block diagram


## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the GPS Module to ESP32:**
   - Connect the TX pin of the GPS module to the RX pin of UART1 on the ESP32 (typically GPIO pins 16 for RX and 17 for TX).
   - Ensure a common ground (GND) connection between the ESP32 and the GPS module.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 using `Serial.begin()` for debugging purposes.
   - Initialize UART1 (Serial1) at 9600 baud rate using `gpsSerial.begin()` for communication with the GPS module.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Check if there is data available to read from the GPS module using `gpsSerial.available()`.
     - Read the incoming GPS data until a newline character (`'\n'`) is encountered using `gpsSerial.readStringUntil('\n')`.
     - Example parsing: Assuming the GPS module sends NMEA sentences, parse relevant information from the data (e.g., GPGGA sentence for location).

3. **Considerations:**
   - **GPS Data Parsing:** NMEA sentences typically begin with a specific identifier (e.g., $GPGGA, $GPRMC). Parse the data accordingly based on your application needs.
   - **Serial Interfaces:** Ensure correct wiring and initialization of UART1 (Serial1) on the ESP32 to communicate with the GPS module.

## Applications
- **Location Tracking:** Obtain latitude, longitude, and altitude data for GPS-based tracking applications.
- **Navigation Systems:** Integrate with navigation applications to provide real-time location updates.
- **IoT Applications:** Use GPS data to geotag sensor data or IoT device locations.

## Notes
- **NMEA Sentences:** GPS modules transmit data in NMEA format, which includes various types of sentences like GPGGA, GPRMC, GPGLL, etc.
- **Data Accuracy:** GPS accuracy depends on several factors including module quality, satellite visibility, and environmental conditions.
